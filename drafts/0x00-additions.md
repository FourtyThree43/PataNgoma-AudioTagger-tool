Your CLI script looks well-structured and covers the basic functionality for showing, updating, and deleting metadata for media files. However, if you want to enhance it further, here are some suggestions for additions or improvements:

1. **Interactive Mode**: You can add an interactive mode that allows users to choose actions from a menu instead of specifying commands directly in the command line. This can provide a more user-friendly experience.

2. **Batch Processing**: Add the capability to process multiple media files in a batch. For example, you can accept a directory as input and apply the same operation (e.g., update or delete) to all media files within that directory.

3. **Search and Filtering**: Implement search and filtering options to find and display media files based on criteria such as artist, album, genre, etc.

4. **Backup and Restore**: Allow users to create backups of metadata before making changes and provide an option to restore metadata from a backup.

5. **Undo/Redo**: Implement undo and redo functionality, so users can revert changes made to metadata.

6. **Metadata Editing**: Allow users to edit metadata interactively, rather than specifying updates as command-line arguments.

7. **Export**: Provide options for exporting metadata to various formats (e.g., CSV, JSON) for analysis or backup.

8. **Metadata Validation**: Implement validation checks for metadata updates to ensure data consistency and integrity.

9. **Logging**: Add logging functionality to keep a record of all operations performed on media files, including timestamped logs.

10. **Configurable Options**: Allow users to set and configure default options for commands, such as specifying a default directory for batch processing or default metadata fields to display.

11. **More Metadata Fields**: Consider adding support for more metadata fields or extensions like cover art, lyrics, and comments.

12. **Testing**: Implement unit tests to ensure the robustness and correctness of your code.

13. **Documentation**: Provide clear and comprehensive documentation for your CLI, including usage examples and descriptions of all available commands and options.

14. **Error Handling**: Implement robust error handling to handle various edge cases and provide informative error messages to users.

15. **User Feedback**: Consider adding a feedback mechanism so users can report issues or suggest improvements directly from the CLI.


Remember to keep user experience in mind and make the CLI as user-friendly as possible. Regularly update and maintain the CLI to address any issues or add new features based on user feedback and evolving requirements.
